Thanks for being around! Before submitting an issue or a pull request, make sure you understand the [code of conduct](https://github.com/meduzen/datetime-attribute/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/meduzen/datetime-attribute/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) (especially if you submit code).

These are very simple and generic.
